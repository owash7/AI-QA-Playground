# AI-Assisted QA Automation Playground

This project demonstrates how AI tools can be responsibly integrated into modern Quality Assurance workflows.

The goal is not to replace QA expertise, but to enhance:
- Test design
- Automation efficiency
- Visual validation
- Defect analysis and reporting

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- Selenium (Python)
- Applitools (Visual AI Testing)
- ChatGPT (Test generation, analysis, and automation assistance)
- GitHub Actions (CI - optional)

## 🧪 Project Modules

### 1. AI-Generated Manual Test Cases
- Created functional and edge-case test scenarios using AI
- Reviewed and refined outputs using QA best practices
- Stored in markdown for traceability

### 2. AI-Assisted Automation
- Converted manual tests into Selenium automation
- Used AI to accelerate script creation
- Improved reliability with waits, assertions, and selector optimization

### 3. AI Visual Testing
- Integrated Applitools for visual regression testing
- Detected UI inconsistencies missed by functional tests

### 4. Defect Analysis & Reporting
- Used AI to analyze test failures
- Generated professional bug reports
- Validated accuracy before documentation
